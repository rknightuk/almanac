Watched Marvel One-Shots - ★★★

- The Consultant (2011)
- A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Thor's Hammer (2011)
- Item 47 (2012)
- Agent Carter (2013)
- All Hail the King (2014)

_The Consultant_ is weird because it's basically an extended version of the Hulk end credits scene. _All Hail the King_ is the best one, mostly because it adds extra context about The Mandarin to Iron Man 3.
