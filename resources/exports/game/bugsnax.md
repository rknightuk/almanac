Played Bugsnax on PS5. This is a lot of fun and feels like if the Pok√©mon catching gameplay had actually progressed it the last 20 years. I have some issues with it (no fast travel, a lot of loading screens, mission design seems messy) but overall I enjoyed it.

The story definitely didn't go where I expected it to.
