Played Initial Thoughts on Red Dead Redemption 2. - I think they used the same cougar sound effect from the first one. When I heard it, I had flashbacks
- The map is _huge_, I'll be surprised if I finish this in less than 100 hours
- The controls for switching weapons, items, and clothing are so confusing
