Played Super Mario Odyssey (Main Story) on Switch. This is going head-on against Jak and Daxter as my favourite platformer ever. Everything about this game oozes quality.

My only complaint is the requirement of motion controls for some sections of the game. Perhaps someone at Nintendo should have tried to complete the game _without_ using them.
