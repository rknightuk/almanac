Played Marvel's Spider-Man on PS4. This is an incredibly fun game right from the start. The combat is fun and swinging through the city is amazing. The story is legitimately good and leaves it open nicely for a sequel.

When May said she knew all along I audibly gasped.

I'm convinced that if Insomniac hadn't made Sunset Overdrive, this game wouldn't anywhere near as good as it is.
