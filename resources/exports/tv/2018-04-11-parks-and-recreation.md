> "Yes, we're gonna get a dish rack, and shower curtains, and a cutting board, but if you think for one second that I'm not also gonna get that marshmallow shooter so I can shoot you in the face with marshmallows when you're asleep, then you're the dumbest woman I know."

Andy Dwyer, Season 3, Episode 11

> "Jogging is the worst. I know it keeps you healthy, but god, at what cost?"
